# Lab 04: Cross-VPC Communication Patterns

## Objective
Implement secure communication between multiple VPCs using VPC Peering, Transit Gateway, and PrivateLink to support a multi-environment enterprise architecture.

## Scenario
Your company is expanding with separate VPCs for production, staging, shared services, and partner integrations. You need to enable secure, controlled communication between these environments.

## Architecture Overview
```
Multi-VPC Enterprise Setup:
├── Production VPC (10.0.0.0/16)
├── Staging VPC (10.1.0.0/16)
├── Shared Services VPC (10.2.0.0/16)
│   ├── Active Directory
│   ├── DNS Resolvers
│   └── Monitoring Systems
└── Partner VPC (10.3.0.0/16)
    └── Third-party integrations
```

## Communication Patterns
- Hub-and-spoke with Transit Gateway
- Selective peering for specific services
- PrivateLink for service exposure
- Cross-account networking

## Tasks

### 1. Create Multiple VPCs
Set up production, staging, and shared services VPCs.

### 2. Implement VPC Peering
Connect VPCs with selective routing.

### 3. Deploy Transit Gateway
Create centralized connectivity hub.

### 4. Configure PrivateLink
Expose services without internet routing.

### 5. Set Up Cross-Account Access
Enable partner VPC connectivity.

### 6. Implement Route Filtering
Control traffic flow between environments.

## Enterprise Considerations
- Network segmentation policies
- Compliance boundaries
- Cost optimization
- Scalability planning
