# Lab 06: Advanced Load Balancing Strategies

## Objective
Implement comprehensive load balancing using Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, and Global Load Balancer to handle enterprise-scale traffic patterns.

## Scenario
Your e-commerce platform experiences variable traffic patterns with global users, requiring sophisticated load balancing strategies for optimal performance and availability.

## Architecture Overview
```
Multi-Layer Load Balancing:
├── Global Layer (Route 53)
│   ├── Geolocation Routing
│   ├── Latency-based Routing
│   └── Health Check Failover
├── Regional Layer (CloudFront)
│   ├── Edge Locations
│   └── Origin Failover
├── Application Layer (ALB)
│   ├── Path-based Routing
│   ├── Host-based Routing
│   └── Target Groups
└── Network Layer (NLB)
    ├── TCP Load Balancing
    ├── Static IP Addresses
    └── Cross-Zone Load Balancing
```

## Traffic Patterns
- Global user distribution
- Seasonal traffic spikes
- Microservices architecture
- Blue-green deployments

## Tasks

### 1. Deploy Application Load Balancer
Configure advanced routing rules and target groups.

### 2. Implement Network Load Balancer
Set up high-performance TCP load balancing.

### 3. Configure Global Load Balancing
Use Route 53 for geographic traffic distribution.

### 4. Set Up Health Checks
Implement comprehensive health monitoring.

### 5. Configure SSL/TLS Termination
Manage certificates and security policies.

### 6. Implement Sticky Sessions
Handle stateful application requirements.

### 7. Test Load Balancing Algorithms
Compare different distribution methods.
