# Lab 08: Multi-Account Networking Strategy

## Objective
Design and implement enterprise multi-account networking using AWS Organizations, shared VPCs, and centralized connectivity management.

## Scenario
Your enterprise has grown to require separate AWS accounts for different business units, environments, and compliance requirements while maintaining centralized network governance.

## Multi-Account Architecture
```
Enterprise Account Structure:
├── Master Account (Organizations)
├── Network Account (Shared Infrastructure)
│   ├── Transit Gateway
│   ├── Direct Connect Gateway
│   ├── Shared Services VPC
│   └── DNS Management
├── Production Accounts
│   ├── Web Services Account
│   ├── Database Account
│   └── Analytics Account
├── Non-Production Accounts
│   ├── Development Account
│   ├── Staging Account
│   └── Testing Account
└── Security Account
    ├── Logging & Monitoring
    ├── Security Tools
    └── Compliance Reporting
```

## Governance Requirements
- Centralized network management
- Cross-account resource sharing
- Consistent security policies
- Cost allocation and optimization
- Compliance boundaries

## Tasks

### 1. Set Up AWS Organizations
Create organizational units and accounts.

### 2. Design Network Account
Implement centralized networking hub.

### 3. Configure Resource Sharing
Share VPCs and subnets across accounts.

### 4. Implement Cross-Account Routing
Set up Transit Gateway sharing.

### 5. Establish DNS Strategy
Centralize DNS management and resolution.

### 6. Configure Monitoring
Implement cross-account network monitoring.

### 7. Set Up Cost Management
Track and allocate network costs.

## Advanced Patterns
- Hub-and-spoke networking
- Shared services architecture
- Network segmentation by account
- Automated account provisioning
