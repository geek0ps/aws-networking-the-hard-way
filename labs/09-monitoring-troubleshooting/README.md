# Lab 09: Network Monitoring and Troubleshooting

## Objective
Implement comprehensive network monitoring, logging, and troubleshooting capabilities using CloudWatch, VPC Flow Logs, and third-party tools.

## Scenario
Your enterprise network spans multiple accounts, regions, and on-premises locations. You need visibility into network performance, security events, and the ability to quickly troubleshoot issues.

## Monitoring Architecture
