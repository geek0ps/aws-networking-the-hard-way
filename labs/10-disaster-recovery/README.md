# Lab 10: Network Disaster Recovery

## Objective
Design and implement a comprehensive network disaster recovery strategy with automated failover, backup connectivity, and rapid recovery procedures.

## Scenario
Your enterprise requires 99.99% uptime with RTO (Recovery Time Objective) of 15 minutes and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) of 5 minutes for critical network services.

## DR Architecture
```
Multi-Region DR Setup:
├── Primary Region (us-east-1)
│   ├── Production VPC
│   ├── Direct Connect
│   └── Primary DNS
├── DR Region (us-west-2)
│   ├── Standby VPC
│   ├── Backup Connectivity
│   └── Secondary DNS
├── Global Services
│   ├── Route 53 Health Checks
│   ├── CloudFront Distribution
│   └── Global Load Balancer
└── Backup Region (eu-west-1)
    ├── Cold Standby
    └── Data Replication
```

## DR Requirements
- Automated failover mechanisms
- Data consistency across regions
- Network path redundancy
- Communication during outages
- Regular DR testing

## Tasks

### 1. Design Multi-Region Architecture
Plan network topology for disaster scenarios.

### 2. Implement Automated Failover
Configure Route 53 health checks and failover.

### 3. Set Up Cross-Region Replication
Ensure data consistency across regions.

### 4. Create Network Redundancy
Implement multiple connectivity paths.

### 5. Build DR Runbooks
Document recovery procedures.

### 6. Test Disaster Scenarios
Validate recovery capabilities.

### 7. Optimize Recovery Time
Minimize RTO through automation.

## Disaster Scenarios
- Regional AWS outage
- Direct Connect failure
- DNS service disruption
- Security incident response
- Natural disaster impact

## Recovery Strategies
- Hot standby (active-active)
- Warm standby (active-passive)
- Cold standby (backup and restore)
- Pilot light approach
